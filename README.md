Sandbox for code written in Go.

**NOTE:** Almost all code on this repository requires Go 1.18+, as it uses type
parameters. To install it, with a previously installed Go toolchain run:

```sh
$ go install golang.org/dl/gotip@latest
# Installs the "gotip" command.
$ gotip download
# Fetches and builds the Go toolchain.
```
